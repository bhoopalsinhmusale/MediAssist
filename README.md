### MediAssist: An Intelligent Medical Assistance

medical queries. The problem with these systems is that these systems accept only keyword-based queries. Searchers find it
difficult to use such search engines because they are not always familiar with medical terminology. To overcome this
problem and to get more accurate medical information, we propose this system. Now a day’s most people are
browsing health care and medical information in their homes using the internet. However, searching this medical
information on the web for them is a bit difficult. Due to the lack of knowledge about medical terms, they often fail to
