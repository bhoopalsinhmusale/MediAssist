carbon dioxide blood results poor lung function depressed breathing (respiratory acidosis)  Blood acidity increases people ingest substances contain produce acid lungs expel carbon dioxide  People metabolic acidosis nausea  vomiting  fatigue breathe faster deeper normal  People respiratory acidosis headache confusion  breathing appear shallow  slow   Tests blood samples typically pH normal range  Doctors treat cause acidosis  (See Overview Acid Base Balance ) increase acid overwhelms body s acid base control systems  blood acidic  blood pH drops (becomes acidic)  parts brain regulate

overwhelmed body continues produce acid  leading severe acidosis eventually heart problems coma  acidity alkalinity solution  including blood  indicated pH scale  Acidity alkalinity expressed pH scale  ranges   (strongly acidic)    (strongly basic alkaline)  pH      middle scale  neutral  Blood normally slightly basic  normal pH range            Usually body maintains pH blood close       Acidosis categorized depending primary cause Metabolic Respiratory Metabolic acidosis develops acid body increased ingestion substance  broken (metabolized)  acid?such wood alcohol (methanol)  antifreeze (ethylene glycol)  large doses aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid)  Metabolic acidosis occur result abnormal metabolism  body produces excess acid advanced stages shock poorly controlled type   diabetes mellitus (diabetic ketoacidosis)  production normal amounts acid lead acidosis kidneys functioning normally able excrete sufficient amounts acid urine  Diabetic ketoacidosis (buildup ketoacids) Drugs substances acetazolamide  alcohols  aspirin Lactic acidosis (buildup lactic acid occurs result shock use certain drugs) Loss bases  bicarbonate  digestive tract diarrhea ileostomy Severe kidney disease Poisons ethylene glycol methanol Renal tubular acidosis (a form kidney malfunction) Respiratory acidosis develops lungs expel carbon dioxide adequately (inadequate ventilation)  problem occur disorders severely affect lungs (such emphysema  chronic bronchitis  severe pneumonia  pulmonary edema  asthma)  Respiratory acidosis develop disorders brain nerves muscles chest impair breathing  addition  people develop respiratory acidosis breathing slowed oversedation opioids (narcotics) strong drugs induce sleep (sedatives)  result slowed breathing  level oxygen blood low  Lung disorders  chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD  includes emphysema chronic bronchitis)  severe asthma  pneumonia  pulmonary edema Sleep disordered breathing (for example  sleep apnea) Disorders nerves muscles chest impair breathing  Guillain Barré syndrome amyotrophic lateral sclerosis Overdose drugs alcohol  opioids  strong sedatives mild metabolic acidosis  people symptoms usually experience Nausea Vomiting Fatigue Breathing deeper slightly faster (as body tries correct acidosis expelling carbon dioxide)  acidosis worsens  people begin feel extremely weak drowsy feel confused increasingly nauseated  Eventually  severe cases  heart problems develop blood pressure fall  leading shock  coma  death  respiratory acidosis  earliest symptoms Headache Drowsiness Drowsiness progress stupor coma oxygen blood inadequate  Stupor coma develop moments breathing stops severely impaired  hours breathing dramatically impaired  Blood tests diagnosis acidosis generally requires measurement blood pH carbon dioxide sample arterial blood  usually taken radial artery wrist  Arterial blood used venous blood generally reliable measuring body?s pH status  learn cause acidosis  doctors measure levels bicarbonate blood  Additional blood tests help determine specific cause  Treatment cause fluids bicarbonate given vein  treatment acidosis directed reversing cause  Doctors rarely simply alkaline drugs  bicarbonate  reverse acidosis  metabolic acidosis  treatment depends primarily cause  instance  treatment needed control diabetes insulin remove toxic substance blood cases poisoning  respiratory acidosis  treatment aims improving function lungs  Drugs open airways (bronchodilators  albuterol) help people lung diseases asthma emphysema  Sedation drugs substances reversed antidotes  People severely impaired breathing lung function  reason  need mechanical ventilation aid breathing  Severe acidosis treated directly does respond efforts treat cause  cases bicarbonate given intravenously   bicarbonate provides temporary relief cause harm?for instance  overloading body sodium water  Tap switch Professional version Usually  a nonfunctional adrenal mass causes
